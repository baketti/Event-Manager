## üìö Project Overview

**Event Manager** is a full-featured frontend application developed as the final project for the *Frontend* course in the **Computer Engineering and AI** degree program. 

The app allows users to browse, search, create, and manage tech-related events. 
It includes features like:

- Authentication (login/registration)
- Role-based access control (Admin vs. Regular User)
- Event creation, modification, deletion
- User management (Admin only)
- Search events with filters
- Clean UI built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI**

The backend is powered by `json-server`, simulating a RESTful API for development and testing purposes.

## üöÄ Project Setup & Installation

To run the Event Manager application locally, follow these steps:

### 1. üì• Clone the Repository

Using HTTPS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/baketti/Event-Manager.git
```
Or using SSH:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:baketti/Event-Manager.git
```

### 2. üì¶ Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project folder and install the required packages:

```bash
cd Event-Manager
npm install
```

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the Development Server

Run the development server and the mock API (json-server) simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will launch both:

- the React frontend (via Vite)

- the mock REST API (via json-server) using the db.json file

By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

### 4. üß™ Test the Application

You can log in using the following test credentials:

#### Admin User

Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123

#### Regular User

Email: mario@example.com
Password: mario123

## üîß Redux Store Architecture

### Store Configuration
The application uses **Redux Toolkit** with **Redux-Saga** for side effects and **Redux Persist** for state persistence. The store is configured with the following middleware stack:

- **Redux-Saga** - Handles async operations and API calls
- **Redux-Persist** - Persists state to localStorage (excludes UI slice)

### Store Slices Organization

Each slice follows a consistent file structure:

#### Available Slices

- **`ajax`** - Manages API loading states and request lifecycle
- **`event`** - Event-related state (events list, current event, filters)
- **`user`** - User authentication, profile, and user management
- **`ui`** - UI state (dialog visibility, modals, notifications)
- **`feedback`** - User feedback and notification messages

### API Request Architecture

#### API Builder Pattern
The application uses a sophisticated API builder pattern that standardizes all HTTP requests:

```typescript
// Each API action is created with:
export const apiActionBuilder = (api, prepare) => ({
  request: createAction(`${api}/request`, prepare),
  success: createAction(`${api}/success`),
  fail: createAction(`${api}/fail`),
  cancel: createAction(`${api}/cancel`)
});
```
## üöÄ Available API Actions

### üì¶ Events API
- `getEvents` ‚Äì Fetch all events
- `getEventsByEventId` ‚Äì Fetch single event details
- `getEventsBySearch` ‚Äì Search events with filters (e.g. location, price, date)
- `postEvents` ‚Äì Create a new event
- `patchEventsByEventId` ‚Äì Update an existing event
- `deleteEventsByEventId` ‚Äì Delete an event
- `patchUsersEventSubscription` ‚Äì Subscribe or unsubscribe a user to/from an event

### üë§ Users API
- `getUsers` ‚Äì Fetch all users (admin only)
- `getUsersByUserId` ‚Äì Get a specific user's details
- `getUsersMe` ‚Äì Retrieve the current logged-in user profile
- `postUsers` ‚Äì Register a new user
- `postUsersByAdmin` ‚Äì Admin creates a user
- `patchUsersByUserId` ‚Äì Edit user details
- `deleteUsersByUserId` ‚Äì Remove a user

### üîê Authentication API
- `postSessions` ‚Äì Log in a user
- `deleteSessions` ‚Äì Log out the current user

---

## üíæ State Persistence

The application uses **Redux Persist** to store selected parts of the Redux state in `localStorage`:

- **Storage**: `localStorage`
- **Key**: `"App-root"`
- **Blacklist**: `ui` slice (to avoid persisting dialog and modal states)

This guarantees that user sessions and preferences persist across reloads, while keeping the UI state clean on each load.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Side Effects with Redux-Saga

The app leverages **Redux-Saga** middleware to handle asynchronous and side-effect logic such as:

- API requests orchestration
- Authentication flow and session management
- Navigation after successful actions (e.g., login or form submit)
- Global error handling and user feedback
- Request cancellation and cleanup

> This architecture ensures robust, scalable, and predictable behavior across all asynchronous flows.

## üß© Component Architecture

### Component Structure
All components in the application follow a consistent two-file architecture pattern for better separation of concerns and maintainability:

### Design Pattern

#### **UI Layer (`index.tsx`)**
- Contains only **presentational logic** and JSX structure
- Focuses on **component composition** and styling
- Handles **prop destructuring** and component rendering
- Keeps components **clean and readable**
- Uses `memo()` for performance optimization

#### **Logic Layer (`index.hooks.tsx`)**
- Manages all **business logic** and state operations
- Handles **Redux interactions** (selectors, dispatchers)
- Contains **form validation** and submission logic
- Manages **side effects** and API calls
- Implements **custom hooks** and utilities

#### **Benefits of This Architecture**
- Testability: Logic is isolated and easily unit testable
- Reusability: Hooks can be shared across components
- Maintainability: Clear separation makes debugging easier
- Performance: UI components can be memoized effectively
- Type Safety: Strong TypeScript support for both layers
- Code Organization: Consistent pattern across the entire codebase

This pattern ensures that components remain focused, maintainable, and follow React best practices while keeping business logic separate from presentation concerns. 

## ‚úÖ Features & Functionality

### üîê Authentication & Role Management
The application supports user authentication with role-based access control:
- **Users** have limited permissions:
  - View all public events
  - Create new events
  - Subscribe/unsubscribe to events (as participants)
- **Admins** have full access:
  - All user permissions
  - Manage all events (edit/delete)
  - Manage users (view, create, edit, delete)
  - Admins **cannot** subscribe to events (the button is disabled for them)

Each user is assigned a role (`user` or `admin`) upon creation.

---

### üßæ Forms & Modals

The application includes various forms and dialog modals for CRUD operations:

#### üìÑ Event Management
- **Create Event**: Modal dialog with form fields
- **Edit Event**: Modal dialog pre-filled with current event data
- **Delete Event**: Confirmation dialog before deletion

#### üë§ User Management (Admins Only)
- **Create User**: Modal dialog with fields for name, email, password, role
- **Edit User**: Modal dialog pre-filled with current user data
- **Delete User**: Confirmation dialog to confirm deletion

#### üîê Authentication
- **Login Form**: Allows users to sign in
- **Registration Form**: Allows users to register a new account

All forms include validation and real-time feedback using `react-hook-form` and `yup`.

---

### üîé Events Filtering & Search

The Events Scene includes advanced filtering capabilities:
- **Location** ‚Äì Filters events by city/location
- **Price** ‚Äì Filters events by maximum price (returns events with price ‚â§ selected value)
- **Date** ‚Äì Filters events by exact date match

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on Date Search**:
Due to limitations with `json-server`, range-based date filters (like `date_gte`, `date_lte`) are not currently supported.
Instead, a strict `date` query is used, returning only events with a date **exactly matching** the selected one.
This may result in **zero or very few matches** depending on the selected day.

> üîç **Important**: The search is triggered **only when clicking the search icon button** to the right of the filters.

---

This set of features ensures a complete event management experience, with secure and intuitive role-based access control and full CRUD support for both users and events.
